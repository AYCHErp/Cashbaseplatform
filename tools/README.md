## Hosting

### Apache2

All applications from `/services` folder are running as local applications on various ports of localhost. To expose them to the interfaces, we need Apache2.
Note that not all applications need to be exposed. E.g. UserIMS yes, as it is directly called from PA-app, but e.g. OrgIMS not, because it is called from 121-service, which is called from PA-app. Also the PA-app and the AW-app are served as web-apps through Apache2.

First, get the right certificates (`SSLCertificateFile` and `SSLCACertificateFile`) and place them in `/tools/certificates/`.

On Ubuntu server do:

    ln -s tools/121-platform.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/121-platform.conf
    ln -s tools/121-platform-https.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/121-platform-https.conf
    a2enmod ssl
    service apache2 restart
    service apache2 status

to check if it started correctly.

## Continuous Deployment

### GitHub webhook

A [GitHub webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) is fired after every merged Pull Request to an endpoint on the server. Upon arrival a script is run. See [`webhook.js`](webhook.js).

This is currently set up. To reproduce, you would follow these steps:

1. (On the Ubuntu server) copy secrets file

       cp tools/example.secrets.json tools/secrets.json

   And fill in the right secret.

2. Create `systemd-service`.  
   First fill in, in `webhook.service`:
   * The right User ('global121' or 'global121production'). This should reflect a user-account on that server with the appropriate permissions. 
   * Also choose 'staging' or 'production' for NODE_ENV, depending on the server.
    
    ```
       cp tools/webhook.service /etc/systemd/system/webhook.service
       sudo service webhook start
       sudo service webhook status
    ```

   The last command checks that the service runs correctly.

3. Expose service with Apache2.  
   See above, [Hosting > Apache2](#apache2).

## Local development

### Git-hooks
Some (optional) scripts are in [`git-hooks/`](git-hooks/) to ease running tests before actually committing or pushing.
